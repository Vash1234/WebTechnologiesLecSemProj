			<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<span class="desc">The most popular server-side language on the web, PHP is designed to pull and edit information in the database. It's most commonly bundled with databases written in the SQL language. PHP was designed strictly for the web and remains one of the most widely used languages around. It's easy to install and deploy, is staying competitive with lots of modern frameworks, and is the foundation for a number of content-management systems. PHP-powered sites: WordPress, Wikipedia, Facebook.</span>
				<span class="desc">Several predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means they are available in all scopes throughout a script. There is no need to do global $variable; to access them within functions or methods.</span>

			<h4>Superglobal variables</h4>
				<span class="item">$GLOBALS</span>
				<span class="desc">An associative array containing references to all variables which are currently defined in the global scope of the script. The variable names are the keys of the array.</span>
				
				<span class="item">$_SERVER</span>
				<span class="desc">$_SERVER is an array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations. The entries in this array are created by the web server. There is no guarantee that every web server will provide any of these; servers may omit some, or provide others not listed here. That said, a large number of these variables are accounted for in the Â» CGI/1.1 specification, so you should be able to expect those.</span>

				<span class="item">$_GET</span>
				<span class="desc">$HTTP_GET_VARS contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note that $HTTP_GET_VARS and $_GET are different variables and that PHP handles them as such)</span>

				<span class="item">$_POST</span>
				<span class="desc">An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method when using application/x-www-form-urlencodedor multipart/form-data as the HTTP Content-Type in the request. $HTTP_POST_VARS contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note that $HTTP_POST_VARS and $_POST are different variables and that PHP handles them as such)</span>

				<span class="item">$_FILES</span>
				<span class="desc">An associative array of items uploaded to the current script via the HTTP POST method. The structure of this array is outlined in thePOST method uploads section. $HTTP_POST_FILES contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note that $HTTP_POST_FILES and $_FILES are different variables and that PHP handles them as such)</span>

				<span class="item">$_COOKIE</span>
				<span class="desc">An associative array of variables passed to the current script via HTTP Cookies. $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note that $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS and $_COOKIE are different variables and that PHP handles them as such)
				</span>

				<span class="item">$_SESSION</span>
				<span class="desc">An associative array containing session variables available to the current script. See the Session functions documentation for more information on how this is used. $HTTP_SESSION_VARS contains the same initial information, but is not a superglobal. (Note that $HTTP_SESSION_VARS and $_SESSION are different variables and that PHP handles them as such)
				</span>

				<span class="item">$_REQUEST</span>
				<span class="desc">An associative array that by default contains the contents of $_GET,$_POST and $_COOKIE.</span>

				<span class="item">$_ENV</span>
				<span class="desc">These variables are imported into PHP's global namespace from the environment under which the PHP parser is running. Many are provided by the shell under which PHP is running and different systems are likely running different kinds of shells, a definitive list is impossible.</span>

				<div id="topic4">

			<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<span class="desc">There are a lot of security issues that are present in the web. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWAS) is an online community that releases the top 10 web security risks every 3 years.</span>
				<span class="desc">Listed here are some of 2017's web security risks</span>

			<h4>Web Security Risks</h4>
				<span class="item">Cross-site scripting</span>
				<span class="desc">Injecting lines of JavaScript into web pages. If not defended against, a hacker can submit malicious code through the search bar, for example, or post it in a user comment</span>
				
				<span class="item">Session Hijacking</span>
				<span class="desc">Each unique user is assigned a "session" when they log in to a website. Session hijackers will jump into the session of another user, reading information as it passes between the user and the server.</span>

				<span class="item">Parameter Manipulation</span>
				<span class="desc">Websites often pass information from one web page to the next through URL parameters. For example, if you search on Google, your search terms will be passed to the results page through the URL. A hacker can take advantage of this fact to rewrite these parameters in harmful ways.</span>

				<span class="item">Buffer overflow</span>
				<span class="desc">A buffer is a small amout of space allotted to store data. If a buffer is overloaded, the extra data will overwrite data in other areas. Hackers have exploited this knowlded to overfill a buffer, than overwrite other data with their own malicious code.</span>

				<span class="item">Denial of service</span>
				<span class="desc">Denial of Service attacks are simple but effective. They operate by overwhelming a site with requests for information, severely slowing the operation of a website or bringing it down entirely</span>

				<span class="item">SQL Injection</span>
				<span class="desc">SQL injection works similarly to cross-site scripting; in this case, however, it is malicious SQL statements that are inserted in the site. These statements are intended to manipulate the database in some way - either accessing sensitive data, or deleting it entirely, causing major headaches for the owners.</span>

				<h4>Prevention</h4>
				<span class="item">What can you do to avoid these threats?</span>
				<span class="desc">The most important thing is not to underestimate the importance of web application security - and put your users and yourself at risk.</span>

				<span class="desc">You can secure a web application by restricting access to certail URL patterns in the web application or programmatically using security calls in your servlet code.</span>

				<span class="desc">At run time, your username and password are authenticated using the applicable security realm for the web application. Authorization is verified according to the security constraints configure in web.xml or the external policies that might have been created for the web application using the Administration Console</span>
